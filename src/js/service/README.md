A collection of "services" available to Thunk actions (or Redux containers). 

In the client's context, a "service" is as a higher-level piece of functionality offered to 
the "controller" part (here is Redux) of the application.

It is usually built on top the action API, and abstracts the details of actual communication
between server and client.
